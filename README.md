ðŸš† **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Train Dataset** ðŸš†

I recently undertook an exciting project where I performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a comprehensive train dataset using **Jupyter Notebook** and **Python**! ðŸ“Šâœ¨ 

The analysis involved a meticulous examination of the dataset through a series of structured steps:

1. **Initial Data Inspection**: 
   - Analyzed the data types and structures of columns across multiple files.
   - Identified and addressed any missing values, ensuring data integrity.
   - Generated a basic statistical summary to grasp key metrics.

2. **Data Cleaning**: 
   - Scrutinized the data for duplicate entries and inconsistencies.
   - Detected outliers that could skew results.

3. **Univariate Analysis**:
   - Visualized the distribution of `Train_No` and `Train_Name` using histograms and bar charts. ðŸ“ˆ
   - Discovered unique counts of source and destination stations, shedding light on travel patterns.
   - Investigated class distributions (1A, 2A, 3A, SL) to evaluate availability trends.

4. **Bivariate Analysis**: 
   - Explored relationships such as the correlation between `Route_Number` and `Distance`.
   - Analyzed how `Departure_Time` affects `Arrival_Time`, using scatter plots for insights. ðŸ“‰
   - Examined travel times across different classes, providing valuable insights for operational improvements.
